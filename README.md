# Singleton Pattern Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton design pattern in a C# application. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Overview
The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a way to access that instance from any part of the application. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Features
Implementation of the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of a class is created.
Global access to the single instance of the class.
Thread-safe instantiation to prevent race conditions in multithreaded environments.
Lazy initialization to defer the creation of the instance until it is first accessed.
## Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/TallesCrhistian/Singleton.git
Open the Project:

Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio.
Run the Application:

Compile and run the application to see the Singleton pattern in action.
## Implementation Details
The project contains a Singleton class with a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
The GetInstance() method provides a static way to access the single instance of the class.
A static lockObject is used to ensure thread safety during the creation of the instance.
Lazy initialization is implemented to create the instance only when it is first accessed.
